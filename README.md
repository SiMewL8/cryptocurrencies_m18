# Crypto Currencies
Analyze different cryptocurrencies to extrapolate common patterns and factors for investment firms looking to *invest* in cryptocurrency.

Using unsupervised machine learning models and algorithms on collections of cryptocurrencies to find patterns when a target feature is missing or and all features unlabeled. The primarily algorithm, K-means, will group similar data of cryptocurrency features into clusters. In addition, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) which helps reduce features and avoid overfitting data.  

Here is a rundown of Unsupervised Machine Learning practice: 

- Understand both supervised and unsupervised learning
- Preprocess data for unsupervised learning with Pandas ```pd.get_dummies```, with training and testing for algorithm processing
- Cluster data using the K-means algorithm with *K* number of clusters with means of data appointed to each cluster
- Determine the best number of centroids clusters for K-means using the elbow-point curve and inertia objective function which measures variation in the dataset
- Use PCA to limit features, avoid overfitting data, and speed up the model by transforming a larger set of variables into a digestible formed set.
